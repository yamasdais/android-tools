# Setup this project
## Gradle wrapper
This project doesn't contain gradle-wrapper.jar and gradlew.
After clone this project from Git repository, you need to generate these files.
To generate these files, you need following command.

```sh
grade wrapper --gradle-version 4.4
```

I use gradle version 4.4 at starting this project, the higher version may works correctly.
